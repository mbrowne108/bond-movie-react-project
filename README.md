# James Bond Movie List

This is a React project written as part of a project for Flatiron School, using data from the James Bond films to build an app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

Runs db.json on Port 3004
Open [http://localhost:3004/movies](http://localhost:3004/movies) to view the raw data in the browser.

## Usage

This app lists and organizes all James Bond films with options to filter by actor or decade. Clicking on each film from the main page routes to an info page for that film, displaying additional information from the server, such as the director, writer(s), composer, etc. Additionally, you can add any of these films to your own personalized "Watch" or "Want to Watch" lists.
